# WFGY 3.0 · TXT-based long-horizon stress-test app (Nebius-ready)

WFGY is an experimental "tension" language and framework for studying how large language models behave under long-horizon, high-pressure reasoning tasks.

WFGY 3.0 · Singularity Demo compresses this language into a single TXT pack. When you upload the TXT to a model and follow the on-screen menu, it acts like a long-horizon evaluation and debugging app: you can see exactly where the model stays coherent, starts to drift, or fully collapses.

This example shows how to run the WFGY 3.0 TXT workflow on **Nebius Token Factory** using its OpenAI-compatible API.
